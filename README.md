# Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to take school and student data and provide a complete analysis that includes student math and reading scores as well as school budget and per capita information for the 15 schools. 

Because of possible academic dishonesty, this analysis removes Thomas High School's ninth grade students' math and reading scores for the school data summary.
